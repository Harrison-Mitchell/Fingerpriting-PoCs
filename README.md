# Fingerpriting-PoCs
What gossip does your browser tell web servers?

It's essentially a dump of all available JS API calls for bits of information used to fingerprint a user. E.g if the user uses Linux, they use Firefox, they use an ad blocker, they live in X city, their internet is Y mbps and they have Z graphics card, we can with high confidence, track this user around the web.

The site shows the API call (and link to it on MDN), your value, an example value, and any notes.

The code is awful, for reasons outlined within. Limit yourself to the frontend, for your own good.
